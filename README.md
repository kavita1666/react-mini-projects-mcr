# React Feature-based Web Application

This is a React-based web application that offers multiple interactive features, including a blog section, login form, image carousel, to-do list, and more. The application is built using React Router for seamless navigation and dynamic content rendering.

## Project Structure

The project is organized using a modular component-based structure, ensuring scalability and maintainability. Here's a breakdown of the main components:

## Main Layout Structure
- html-container: The outermost container that wraps the entire application.
- NavBar: A navigation bar that provides links for navigating to different sections of the app.
- body-container: Contains the main content, including an accordion and the dynamic routing area.
- content-container: A section where React Router dynamically loads the relevant component based on the route.

## Features/Components
The following components are loaded dynamically based on the URL route:

- **BlogsContainer**: Displays a collection of blogs.
- **ImageCarousel**: An interactive image carousel to display images in a slideshow format.
- **Todolist**: A to-do list where users can manage tasks.

- **ProgressBar**: A visual progress bar to indicate the completion status of a task.
- **StarRating**: A rating system to collect user feedback.
- **DragAndDrop**: A component allowing users to drag and drop elements within the UI.
